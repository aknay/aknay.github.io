   <p>
   I'm aknay. I love tinkering with all sorts of things; IoT, web and mobile apps developement. I bake my code to be reuseable and extendable with a sprinkle of tests. </p>

   <p>I'm a big fan of Scala now. I also wirte code in Java, Kotlin, C++, Python, C and JavaScript. I usually commit my code in <a href="https://github.com/aknay" target="_blank">Github</a>.<p>

   <p>Beside coding, I play Ukelele and learn to make a conversion with French and Japanese people. </p>

   <p>Psst, you can take look at my apps in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=MakerDevLab" target="_blank">Android Store</a></p>

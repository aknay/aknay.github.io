   <p>
   I'm aknay. I love tinkering with all sorts of things; IoT, web and apps developement. I bake my code to be reuseable and extendable with a sprinkle of tests. </p>

   <p>I'm a big fan of Scala now. I also wirte code in C, C++, Python, Java and JavaScript. I usually commit my code in <a href="https://github.com/aknay" target="_blank">Github</a>.<p>

   <p>Beside coding, I play Ukelele and learn to make a conversion with French and Japanese people. </p>

   <p>Psst, you can take look at my app in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.maker.makerio&hl=en" target="_blank">Android Store</a></p>
